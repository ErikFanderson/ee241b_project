	abstract = {The virtuous cycle of integrated-circuit technology advancement has been sustained for over 50 years, resulting in the proliferation of information technology (IT) with dramatic economic and social impact. Although there is still some “room at the bottom” today to manipulate and control matter at ever smaller scales, physics and economics limit the benefits of further transistor scaling. This paper discusses how the computational functionality and energy efficiency of microchips can be enhanced by integrating MEM switches on top of transistors, to sustain the IT revolution.},

	abstract = {Nanoelectromechanical (NEM) relays are promising candidates for programmable routing in Field-Programmable-Gate Arrays (FPGAs). This is due to their zero leakage and potentially low on-resistance. Moreover, NEM relays can be fabricated using a low-temperature process and, hence, may be monolithically integrated on top of CMOS circuits. Hysteresis characteristics of NEM relays can be utilized for designing programmable routing switches in FPGAs without requiring corresponding routing SRAM cells. Our simulation results demonstrate that the use of NEM relays for programmable routing in FPGAs can simultaneously provide 43.6\% footprint area reduction, 37\% leakage power reduction, and up to 28\% critical path delay reduction compared to traditional SRAM-based CMOS FPGAs at the 22nm technology node.},

	abstract = {To overcome the energy-efficiency limitations imposed by finite sub-threshold slope in CMOS transistors, this paper explores the design of integrated circuits based on nanoelectro-mechanical (NEM) relays. A dynamical Verilog-A model of the NEM relay is described and correlated to device measurements. Using this model we explore NEM relay design strategies for digital logic and I/O that can significantly improve the energy efficiency of the whole VLSI system. By exploiting the low effective threshold voltage and zero leakage achievable with these relays, we show that NEM relay-based adders can achieve an order of magnitude or more improvement in energy efficiency over CMOS adders with nsrange delays and with no area penalty. By applying parallelism, this improvement in energy-efficiency can be achieved at higher throughputs as well, at the cost of increased area. Similar improvements in high-speed I/O energy are also predicted by making use of the relays to implement highly energy-efficient digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters.},

	doi = {10.1109/FPL.2013.6645511},
	abstract = {Pass-transistors have been the key building block for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) circuitry for many years due to the very small switch they enable. However, passtransistor performance and reliability have been degrading with technology scaling. Transmission gates are an alternative to pass-transistors; while larger, they are more robust. We develop a new FPGA circuit optimization flow and use it to investigate the area, delay and power impact of building FPGAs out of transmission gates instead of pass-transistors in a 22nm process. Our results show that transmission gate FPGAs are 15\% larger than pass-transistor FPGAs but are 10-25\% faster depending on the allowable level of “gate boosting”. Without gate boosting, transmission gate FPGAs are the better option with 14\% lower area-delay product. If 200mV of gate boosting is possible however, pass-transistor FPGAs remain the slightly better choice with a 2\% better area-delay product. We also show that transmission gates with a separate power supply for their gate terminal enable a low-voltage FPGA with 50\% less power and good delay.},

abstract = {The need for more energy-efficient solid-state switches beyond complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors has become a major concern as the power consumption of electronic integrated circuits (ICs) steadily increases with technology scaling. Nano-Electro-Mechanical (NEM) relays control current flow by nanometer-scale motion to make or break physical contact between electrodes, and offer advantages over transistors for low-power digital logic applications: virtually zero leakage current for negligible static power consumption; the ability to operate with very small voltage signals for low dynamic power consumption; and robustness against harsh environments such as extreme temperatures. Therefore, NEM logic switches (relays) have been investigated by several research groups during the past decade. Circuit simulations calibrated to experimental data indicate that scaled relay technology can overcome the energy-efficiency limit of CMOS technology. This paper reviews recent progress toward this goal, providing an overview of the different relay designs and experimental results achieved by various research groups, as well as of relay-based IC design principles. Remaining challenges for realizing the promise of nano-mechanical computing, and ongoing efforts to address these, are discussed.},
